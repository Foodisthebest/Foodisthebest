### I love all food except seafood.

That being said, here's more about me:

**_What is this repo all about?_**

This repo is for my (hopefully) future career in cybersecurity. I'm currently doing the bootcamp at Code Fellows for it. Pray for me. 🙏 I anticipate getting better in my skills and knowledge, so look forward to better stuff as I go along. 😃 <-- (This is actually my typical face, no joke.)

**_Why are you learning these skills?_**

I believe that the world is heading in a dark direction, with the cyber world being used and abused to aid and abet terrible people and ideas. I want to be part of the solution instead of whining about people's human rights being taken away. As human beings, we have the right to not suffer from corruption. I hope to one day begin teaching people cybersecurity skills to protect themselves and others, as well as work with organizations that prevent and end exploitation of any kind. Yes, it's dramatic, but you asked why I'm learning these skills haha. 🤓

**_What fundamental concepts did you learn in Ops 201?_**

Basic networking, basic security measures (OPSEC), basic BASH scripting/Powershell scripting, and use of VMs. And I STILL don't understand them all 100% or even 60% lol. 🤭

**_What was your favorite Ops Challenge assignment and why?_**

None of them actually, because scripting is really hard for me and I'm still struggling super hard in understanding and putting it to use. I'm not joking when I say it's going over my head, but I really am trying. I definately (sp?) need to practice more. 🤦‍♀️

**_How can these examples of shell scripting be applied to the workplace?_**

Troubleshooting, pen testing, changing computer behavior... yeah, there's so many things I can mess around with to mess with people. 😆 Seriously though, I think shell scripting gives you much better control and security over your systems- something 100% neccessary for anyone, anywhere, not just in the workplace, to protect yourself.

**_What scripts would you continue to improve if you had the time?_**

All of them. 😖

**_What aspect of your shell scripting skillset do you hope to improve next?_**

My understanding of syntax. Syntax really gets me. I can read a script, but knowing every single bit of syntax is a struggle for me. I mean, who made up the idea that a semicolon should be part of scripting anyways? 🙄 Who planned on spaces in a script actually meaning something!?
